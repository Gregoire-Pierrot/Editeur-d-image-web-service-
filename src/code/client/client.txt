My journey with English began in middle school, where it was introduced as part of the curriculum. At first, my focus was on learning basic grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structures. As I advanced through school, my studies shifted towards more complex grammatical rules and reading comprehension. However, I faced challenges, particularly in speaking and listening. In a non-English-speaking environment, I had limited opportunities to practice conversational skills, which made me hesitant to speak. Listening was also difficult, especially when trying to understand different accents or fast-paced dialogues.

My strongest skills are reading and writing. I find it easier to understand written texts and express my thoughts on paper. On the other hand, my speaking and listening skills are weaker, as I often struggle with fluency and understanding fast speech. Watching movies and TV series has been incredibly helpful in improving my listening skills and expanding my vocabulary. Additionally, playing video games with English-speaking players allows me to practice casual conversation in a fun and relaxed setting. While formal learning has its place, Iâ€™ve found that these informal methods work better for my progress, making the language more engaging and practical for everyday use.
